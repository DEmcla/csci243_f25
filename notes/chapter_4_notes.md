## üéØ CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------
Data types tell the database what kind of information you're storing. It's
like labeling boxes so you know what goes inside each one.

## üîë KEY CONCEPTS
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ TEXT/VARCHAR - For storing words and sentences (like names, descriptions)
‚Ä¢ INTEGER - For whole numbers (like age, count of items)
‚Ä¢ DECIMAL/NUMERIC - For numbers with decimal points (like prices,
  measurements)
‚Ä¢ DATE - For storing dates (birthdays, deadlines, etc.)
‚Ä¢ BOOLEAN - For true/false values (yes/no, active/inactive)

## üîß WORKING WITH VS CODE
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Install the **PostgreSQL** extension for syntax highlighting
‚Ä¢ Use **SQLTools** extension to connect to your database
‚Ä¢ Save your SQL files with .sql extension
‚Ä¢ Use Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/ on Mac) for quick comments

## üí° BEGINNER TIPS
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Choose the most specific data type that fits your data
‚Ä¢ TEXT is good for variable-length strings
‚Ä¢ Use INTEGER for counting things
‚Ä¢ DECIMAL is perfect for money and precise measurements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Forgetting the semicolon (;) at the end of SQL statements
‚Ä¢ Using single quotes (') for column names instead of double quotes (")
‚Ä¢ Not backing up your work regularly
‚Ä¢ Trying to memorize everything instead of understanding concepts

## üèãÔ∏è PRACTICE EXERCISES
----------------------------------------
1. Start with the examples in the textbook
2. Modify the examples slightly to see what happens
3. Create your own simple variations
4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn!

## üÜò GETTING HELP
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Review the textbook section again
‚Ä¢ Check your SQL syntax carefully
‚Ä¢ Try breaking complex queries into smaller parts
‚Ä¢ Ask classmates or instructor for help
‚Ä¢ Use online resources like PostgreSQL documentation

## üìù CHAPTER SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This chapter covered essential database concepts that build your foundation
for working with data. Remember: everyone learns at their own pace, and
it's normal to need practice with these concepts.
