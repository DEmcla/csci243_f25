## üéØ CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------
The command line gives you powerful tools for database administration and
automation.

## üîë KEY CONCEPTS
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ psql - PostgreSQL's command-line interface
‚Ä¢ Command-line Tools - Programs you run from terminal/command prompt
‚Ä¢ Batch Operations - Running multiple commands at once
‚Ä¢ Automation Scripts - Making repetitive tasks automatic

## üíª PLATFORM-SPECIFIC SETUP
----------------------------------------
**Windows:** Use Command Prompt or PowerShell. Add PostgreSQL to your PATH.
**Mac:** Use Terminal app. PostgreSQL tools should be in your PATH after installation.
**Linux:** Use your preferred terminal. Install postgresql-client if needed.

## üîß WORKING WITH VS CODE
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Install the **PostgreSQL** extension for syntax highlighting
‚Ä¢ Use **SQLTools** extension to connect to your database
‚Ä¢ Save your SQL files with .sql extension
‚Ä¢ Use Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/ on Mac) for quick comments

## üí° BEGINNER TIPS
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Don't be intimidated by the command line - it's just another way to
  interact with PostgreSQL
‚Ä¢ Start with simple commands and gradually build complexity
‚Ä¢ Keep a cheat sheet of common commands handy
‚Ä¢ Practice basic navigation in terminal/command prompt first

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Forgetting the semicolon (;) at the end of SQL statements
‚Ä¢ Using single quotes (') for column names instead of double quotes (")
‚Ä¢ Not backing up your work regularly
‚Ä¢ Trying to memorize everything instead of understanding concepts

## üèãÔ∏è PRACTICE EXERCISES
----------------------------------------
1. Start with the examples in the textbook
2. Modify the examples slightly to see what happens
3. Create your own simple variations
4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn!

## üÜò GETTING HELP
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Review the textbook section again
‚Ä¢ Check your SQL syntax carefully
‚Ä¢ Try breaking complex queries into smaller parts
‚Ä¢ Ask classmates or instructor for help
‚Ä¢ Use online resources like PostgreSQL documentation

## üìù CHAPTER SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This chapter covered essential database concepts that build your foundation
