================================================================================

## üéØ CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------
Text contains valuable information. Learn how to search, clean, and analyze
text data effectively.

## üîë KEY CONCEPTS
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ String Functions - Tools for working with text
‚Ä¢ Pattern Matching - Finding specific text patterns
‚Ä¢ Regular Expressions - Powerful pattern matching
‚Ä¢ Text Cleaning - Removing extra spaces, fixing case

## üîß WORKING WITH VS CODE
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Install the **PostgreSQL** extension for syntax highlighting
‚Ä¢ Use **SQLTools** extension to connect to your database
‚Ä¢ Save your SQL files with .sql extension
‚Ä¢ Use Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/ on Mac) for quick comments

## üí° BEGINNER TIPS
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Start with simple string functions like UPPER(), LOWER(), TRIM()
‚Ä¢ Use LIKE for basic pattern matching before trying regular expressions
‚Ä¢ Clean text data gradually - fix one issue at a time
‚Ä¢ Test pattern matching on small datasets first

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Forgetting the semicolon (;) at the end of SQL statements
‚Ä¢ Using single quotes (') for column names instead of double quotes (")
‚Ä¢ Not backing up your work regularly
‚Ä¢ Trying to memorize everything instead of understanding concepts

## üèãÔ∏è PRACTICE EXERCISES
----------------------------------------
1. Start with the examples in the textbook
2. Modify the examples slightly to see what happens
3. Create your own simple variations
4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn!

## üÜò GETTING HELP
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Review the textbook section again
‚Ä¢ Check your SQL syntax carefully
‚Ä¢ Try breaking complex queries into smaller parts
‚Ä¢ Ask classmates or instructor for help
‚Ä¢ Use online resources like PostgreSQL documentation

## üìù CHAPTER SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This chapter covered essential database concepts that build your foundation
for working with data. Remember: everyone learns at their own pace, and
it's normal to need practice with these concepts.
