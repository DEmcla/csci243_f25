================================================================================

## 🎯 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------
JOINs let you combine information from multiple tables. Think of it like
connecting related file folders to get a complete picture.

## 🔑 KEY CONCEPTS
----------------------------------------
• INNER JOIN - Shows only records that exist in both tables
• LEFT JOIN - Shows all records from the left table, plus matches from the
  right
• Foreign Key - A column that refers to data in another table
• Primary Key - A unique identifier for each row in a table

## 🔧 WORKING WITH VS CODE
----------------------------------------
• Install the **PostgreSQL** extension for syntax highlighting
• Use **SQLTools** extension to connect to your database
• Save your SQL files with .sql extension
• Use Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/ on Mac) for quick comments

## 💡 BEGINNER TIPS
----------------------------------------
• Start with simple two-table joins
• Draw pictures to visualize how tables connect
• Think about the relationship between tables before joining
• Use table aliases (short names) to make queries readable

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
----------------------------------------
• Forgetting the semicolon (;) at the end of SQL statements
• Using single quotes (') for column names instead of double quotes (")
• Not backing up your work regularly
• Trying to memorize everything instead of understanding concepts

## 🏋️ PRACTICE EXERCISES
----------------------------------------
1. Start with the examples in the textbook
2. Modify the examples slightly to see what happens
3. Create your own simple variations
4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn!

## 🆘 GETTING HELP
----------------------------------------
• Review the textbook section again
• Check your SQL syntax carefully
• Try breaking complex queries into smaller parts
• Ask classmates or instructor for help
• Use online resources like PostgreSQL documentation

## 📝 CHAPTER SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This chapter covered essential database concepts that build your foundation
for working with data. Remember: everyone learns at their own pace, and
it's normal to need practice with these concepts.
