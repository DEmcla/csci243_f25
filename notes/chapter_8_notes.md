Good table design makes your database easier to use and maintain. It's like
organizing your filing system efficiently.

‚Ä¢ Primary Keys - Unique identifiers for each row
‚Ä¢ Normalization - Organizing data to reduce redundancy
‚Ä¢ Constraints - Rules that keep your data clean and consistent
‚Ä¢ Indexes - Speed up searches (like a book's index)

## üîß WORKING WITH VS CODE
----------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Install the **PostgreSQL** extension for syntax highlighting
‚Ä¢ Use **SQLTools** extension to connect to your database
‚Ä¢ Save your SQL files with .sql extension
‚Ä¢ Use Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/ on Mac) for quick comments
